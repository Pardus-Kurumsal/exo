exo (0.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Due to multi-arch changes, helpers and libs in the libexo-1-0 packages have
  been moved to a subfolder in /usr/lib/<arch>/xfce4/exo-1/. This means some
  packages (like xfce4-terminal) might not find the tools anymore until they
  are restarted with the new library.
